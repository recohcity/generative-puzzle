Based on my analysis of the generative-puzzle project, here are the key architectural issues and improvement recommendations:

## Architectural Inconsistencies

### 1. Dual Device Detection Systems
The project has redundant device detection logic in two separate locations. DeviceManager.ts:48-175 implements its own detection system, while canvasAdaptation.ts:385-470 has another complete detection function. This creates inconsistency and maintenance overhead.

**Improvement**: Consolidate all device detection logic into a single, authoritative source in `DeviceManager.ts` and remove the duplicate `getDeviceLayoutMode` function from `canvasAdaptation.ts`.

### 2. Configuration Parameter Duplication
Canvas size constants are duplicated across multiple files. AdaptationEngine.ts:9-50 defines ADAPTATION_CONFIG with the same parameters found in canvasAdaptation.ts:7-58 . Device thresholds are also duplicated between DeviceManager.ts:32-35 and the constants file.

**Improvement**: Create a single configuration source and import it consistently across all modules. Remove `ADAPTATION_CONFIG` from `AdaptationEngine.ts` and use the existing constants from `canvasAdaptation.ts`.

### 3. iPhone 16 Detection Logic Duplication
iPhone 16 series detection is implemented twice: DeviceManager.ts:177-238 and canvasAdaptation.ts:316-379 have nearly identical detection logic with slight variations.
**Improvement**: Move the iPhone 16 detection to `DeviceManager.ts` as the single source of truth and remove the duplicate from `canvasAdaptation.ts`.

## Timing Workarounds Issues

### 1. Multiple Cascading setTimeout Calls useCanvas.ts:111-121 implements three separate setTimeout calls (300ms, 600ms, 1000ms) as a workaround for canvas sizing issues. This creates unpredictable behavior and performance issues.

**Improvement**: Replace the multiple setTimeout calls with:
- A proper ResizeObserver implementation for all device types
- Event-driven updates based on device state changes
- A single debounced update function with appropriate delay

### 2. Scattered Event Debouncing
The project has inconsistent debouncing implementations: EventManager.ts:145-182 provides centralized debouncing, but useCanvas.ts:95-108 implements its own timing delays.

**Improvement**: Standardize on the `EventManager`'s debouncing system for all timing-sensitive operations and remove ad-hoc setTimeout usage.

## Mixed Responsibilities

### 1. DeviceManager Scope Creep DeviceManager.ts:177-238   contains hardcoded iPhone 16 model specifications and canvas-specific logic, which should be separated from device detection responsibilities.

**Improvement**: 
- Keep DeviceManager focused solely on device detection and state management
- Move iPhone model specifications to a separate configuration file
- Remove canvas-specific calculations from the device manager

### 2. AdaptationEngine Mixed Concerns AdaptationEngine.ts:274-361  mixes general adaptation algorithms with puzzle-specific logic and contains verbose console logging throughout the adaptation process.

**Improvement**:
- Separate generic adaptation utilities from puzzle-specific logic
- Create a dedicated PuzzleAdaptationService for puzzle-specific operations
- Extract logging to a centralized logging service with configurable levels

### 3. useCanvas Hook Overloaded useCanvas.ts:45-154   combines canvas management, device detection, event handling, and timing workarounds in a single hook.

**Improvement**:
- Split into focused hooks: `useCanvasSize`, `useCanvasRefs`, `useDeviceAdaptation`
- Move device-specific logic to DeviceManager subscribers
- Create separate hooks for different canvas operations

## Recommended Refactoring Strategy

1. **Create a Configuration Layer**: Establish `src/config/` with centralized constants and eliminate all duplications

2. **Implement Proper Separation of Concerns**:
   - DeviceManager: Pure device detection and state
   - CanvasManager: Canvas operations and coordinate transformations
   - AdaptationEngine: Generic adaptation algorithms only
   - PuzzleAdaptationService: Puzzle-specific adaptation logic

3. **Replace Timing Workarounds**: Use event-driven architecture with proper observers instead of setTimeout chains

4. **Centralize Logging**: Create a configurable logging service to replace scattered console.log statements

5. **Standardize Event Handling**: Use EventManager consistently for all event operations and remove duplicate event listeners

These improvements would significantly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and eliminate the timing-related bugs that the current setTimeout workarounds attempt to address.

## Notes

The current architecture shows signs of rapid development where workarounds were added to solve immediate issues without addressing root causes. The refactoring should be done incrementally, starting with configuration consolidation and then addressing the mixed responsibilities pattern that has evolved over time.
