# Task 1 Completed Successfully! ✅
I have successfully implemented the unified configuration directory structure as specified in the requirements. Here's what was accomplished:

Created Configuration Files:
src/config/deviceConfig.ts - Device detection configuration

Device detection thresholds (desktop, tablet, mobile breakpoints)
iPhone 16 series specifications and models
Detection tolerance and configuration parameters
User agent patterns for mobile detection
TypeScript interfaces for device state and detection results
src/config/adaptationConfig.ts - Adaptation parameters configuration

Desktop adaptation parameters (margins, panel settings, canvas limits)
Mobile adaptation parameters (portrait/landscape modes, safe areas)
iPhone 16 series optimization parameters
High resolution mobile device optimization settings
Canvas safety margins and calculation parameters
TypeScript interfaces for adaptation context and results
src/config/performanceConfig.ts - Performance-related configuration

Event handling and timing configuration (debounce, throttle settings)
Memory and resource management settings
Performance monitoring thresholds
Optimization flags and browser compatibility settings
Error handling and recovery configuration
Logging and monitoring configuration
src/config/index.ts - Unified export file

Centralized imports and re-exports of all configuration modules

DESKTOP_MIN_WIDTH = 1024 → DEVICE_THRESHOLDS.DESKTOP_MIN_WIDTH
TABLET_MIN_WIDTH = 640 → DEVICE_THRESHOLDS.TABLET_MIN_WIDTH
iPhone 16 Model Specifications Migrated (DeviceManager.ts:177-238):

Complete iPhone 16 series model definitions moved to IPHONE16_MODELS in deviceConfig.ts
All 5 models (16e, 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max) with portrait/landscape dimensions
Detection tolerance moved to DETECTION_CONFIG.IPHONE16_TOLERANCE
User Agent Patterns Unified:

Replaced hardcoded regex patterns with USER_AGENT_PATTERNS from configuration
Improved maintainability and consistency
